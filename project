Casual Coded Correspondence: The Project
In this project, you will be working to code and decode various messages between you and your fictional cryptography enthusiast pen pal Vishal. You and Vishal have been exchanging letters for quite some time now and have started to provide a puzzle in each one of your letters. Here is his most recent letter:

 Hey there! How have you been? I've been great! I just learned about this really cool type of cipher called a  Caesar Cipher. Here's how it works: You take your message, something like "hello" and then you shift all of the letters by a certain offset. For example, if I chose an offset of 3 and a message of "hello", I would code my message by shifting each letter 3 places to the left (with respect to the alphabet). So "h" becomes "e", "e" becomes, "b", "l" becomes "i", and "o" becomes "l". Then I have my coded message,"ebiil"! Now I can send you my message and the offset and you can decode it. The best thing is that Julius Caesar himself used this cipher, that's why it's called the Caesar Cipher! Isn't that so cool! Okay, now I'm going to send you a longer coded message that you have to decode yourself!

    xuo jxuhu! jxyi yi qd unqcfbu ev q squiqh syfxuh. muhu oek qrbu je tusetu yj? y xefu ie! iudt cu q cuiiqwu rqsa myjx jxu iqcu evviuj!

This message has an offset of 10. Can you decode it?


Step 1: Decode Vishal's Message
In the cell below, use your Python skills to decode Vishal's message and print the result. Hint: you can account for shifts that go past the end of the alphabet using the modulus operator, but I'll let you figure out how!

alfabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

def decoder(code, offset):
    decryp = ""
    for i in code:
        if i in alfabet:
            value = alfabet.find(i)
            decryp += alfabet[(value + offset) % len(alfabet)]
        else: decryp += i
                    
    return decryp    
print(decoder("xuo jxuhu! jxyi yi qd unqcfbu ev q squiqh syfxuh. muhu oek qrbu je tusetu yj? y xefu ie! iudt cu q cuiiqwu rqsa myjx jxu iqcu evviuj!", 10))
Hey Vishal, Martin here hope it is okay!
Step 2: Send Vishal a Coded Message
Great job! Now send Vishal back a message using the same offset. Your message can be anything you want! Remember, coding happens in opposite direction of decoding.

def encoder(sentence, offset):
    encryp = ""
    for i in sentence:
        if i in alfabet:
            value = alfabet.find(i)
            encryp += alfabet[(value - offset) % len(alfabet)]
        else:
            encryp += i
    return encryp

print(encoder("Hey Vishal, Martin here hope it is okay!", 10))
    
Huo Vyixqb, Mqhjyd xuhu xefu yj yi eaqo!
Step 3: Make functions for decoding and coding
Vishal sent over another reply, this time with two coded messages!

You're getting the hang of this! Okay here are two more messages, the first one is coded just like before with  an offset of ten, and it contains the hint for decoding the second message!

First message:

    jxu evviuj veh jxu iusedt cuiiqwu yi vekhjuud.

Second message:

    bqdradyuzs ygxfubxq omqemd oubtqde fa oapq kagd yqeemsqe ue qhqz yadq eqogdq!

Decode both of these messages.

If you haven't already, define two functions decoder(message, offset) and coder(message, offset) that can be used to quickly decode and code messages given any offset.

print(decoder("jxu evviuj veh jxu iusedt cuiiqwu yi vekhjuud.", 10))
the offset for the second message is fourteen.
print(decoder("bqdradyuzs ygxfubxq omqemd oubtqde fa oapq kagd yqeemsqe ue qhqz yadq eqogdq!", 14))
performing multiple caesar ciphers to code your messages is even more secure!
Step 4: Solving a Caesar Cipher without knowing the shift value
Awesome work! While you were working to decode his last two messages, Vishal sent over another letter! He's really been bitten by the crytpo-bug. Read it and see what interesting task he has lined up for you this time.

        Hello again friend! I knew you would love the Caesar Cipher, it's a cool simple way to encrypt messages. Did you know that back in Caesar's time, it was considered a very secure way of communication and it took a lot of effort to crack if you were unaware of the value of the shift? That's all changed with computers! Now we can brute force these kinds of ciphers very quickly, as I'm sure you can imagine.

        To test your cryptography skills, this next coded message is going to be harder than the last couple to crack. It's still going to be coded with a Caesar Cipher but this time I'm not going to tell you the value of   the shift. You'll have to brute force it yourself.

        Here's the coded message:

        vhfinmxkl atox kxgwxkxw tee hy maxlx hew vbiaxkl tl hulhexmx. px'ee atox mh kxteer lmxi ni hnk ztfx by px ptgm mh dxxi hnk fxlltzxl ltyx.

        Good luck!

Decode Vishal's most recent message and see what it says!

for i in range(len(alfabet)): # the offset is 8
    print("Output "+ str(i) + ": \n\t" + decoder("vhfinmxkl atox kxgwxkxw tee hy maxlx hew vbiaxkl tl hulhexmx. px'ee atox mh kxteer lmxi ni hnk ztfx by px ptgm mh dxxi hnk fxlltzxl ltyx.", i)+"\n" )

Step 5: The Vigenère Cipher
Great work! While you were working on the brute force cracking of the cipher, Vishal sent over another letter. That guy is a letter machine!

        Salutations! As you can see, technology has made brute forcing simple ciphers like the Caesar Cipher extremely easy, and us crypto-enthusiasts have had to get more creative and use more complicated ciphers. This next cipher I'm going to teach you is the Vigenère Cipher, invented by an Italian cryptologist named Giovan Battista Bellaso (cool name eh?) in the 16th century, but named after another cryptologist from the 16th century, Blaise de Vigenère.

       The Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, as opposed to the Caesar Cipher which was a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. What this means is that opposed to having a single shift that is applied to every letter, the Vigenère Cipher has a different shift for each individual letter. The value of the shift for each letter is determined by a given keyword.

       Consider the message

           barryisthespy

       If we want to code this message, first we choose a keyword. For this example, we'll use the keyword

           dog

       Now we use the repeat the keyword over and over to generate a _keyword phrase_ that is the same length as the message we want to code. So if we want to code the message "barryisthespy" our _keyword phrase_ is "dogdogdogdogd". Now we are ready to start coding our message. We shift the first letter by the difference between the place value of the first letter in the message and the place value of the first letter in the keyword phrase.

                    message:       b  a  r  r  y  i  s  t  h  e  s  p  y

             keyword phrase:       d  o  g  d  o  g  d  o  g  d  o  g  d

  difference in place value:       4  14 15 12 16 24 11 21 25 22 22 17 5

        So we shift "b" by four places and get "e", we shift "a" by 14 places and get "o", we shift "r" by 15 places and get "x", shift the next "r" by 12 places and "u", and so forth. Once we complete all the shifts we end up with our coded message:

            eoxumovhnhgvb

        As you can imagine, this is a lot harder to crack without knowing the keyword! So now comes the hard part. I'll give you a message and the keyword, and you'll see if you can figure out how to crack it! Ready? Okay here's my message:

            dfc jhjj ifyh yf hrfgiv xulk? vmph bfzo! qtl eeh gvkszlfl yyvww kpi hpuvzx dl tzcgrywrxll!

        and the keyword to decode my message is 

            friends

        Because that's what we are! Good luck friend!

And there it is. Vishal has given you quite the assignment this time! Try to decode his message. It may be helpful to create a function that takes two parameters, the coded message and the keyword and then work towards a solution from there.

def vigenere_decoder_and_encoder(message, key, mode):
    out = []
    keyword_repeat = ''
    while len(keyword_repeat) < len(message):
        keyword_repeat += key
    keyword_final = keyword_repeat[0:len(message)]
    
    for index in range(0,len(message)):
        
        if message[index] in alfabet:
            if mode == 'decode':
                index = alfabet.find(message[index]) - (alfabet.find(keyword_final[index])) #Substract when decrypting
            elif mode == 'encode':
                index = alfabet.find(message[index]) + (alfabet.find(keyword_final[index])) #Add when encrypting
            index %= len(alfabet) 
            
            out.append(alfabet[index]) #add the letter to the list 
            
        else:
            out.append(message[index])
            
    return ''.join(out) #join all elements from the list 

print(vigenere_decoder_and_encoder("dfc jhjj ifyh yf hrfgiv xulk? vmph bfzo! qtl eeh gvkszlfl yyvww kpi hpuvzx dl tzcgrywrxll!", "friends", 'decode'))
you were able to decode this? nice work! you are becoming quite the expert at crytography!
Step 6: Send a message with the Vigenère Cipher
Great work decoding the message. For your final task, write a function that can encode a message using a given keyword and write out a message to send to Vishal!

# In the previous function we have an if statement that checks the mode: encode or decode.
# That's why we take a third parameter with us. Much better for reusability.
print(vigenere_decoder_and_encoder("hej, how are you?", "lover", 'encode'))
sse, scr rcs cff?
Conclusion
Over the course of this project you've learned about two different cipher methods and have used your Python skills to code and decode messages. There are all types of other facinating ciphers out there to explore, and Python is the perfect language to implement them with, so go exploring!
